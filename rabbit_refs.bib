    abstract = {<p>Dingoes/wild dogs (<italic>Canis dingo</italic>/<italic>familiaris</italic>) and red foxes (<italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>) are widespread carnivores in southern Australia and are controlled to reduce predation on domestic livestock and native fauna. We used the occurrence of food items in 5875 dingo/wild dog scats and 11,569 fox scats to evaluate interspecific and geographic differences in the diets of these species within nine regions of Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The nine regions encompass a wide variety of ecosystems. Diet overlap between dingoes/wild dogs and foxes varied among regions, from low to near complete overlap. The diet of foxes was broader than dingoes/wild dogs in all but three regions, with the former usually containing more insects, reptiles and plant material. By contrast, dingoes/wild dogs more regularly consumed larger mammals, supporting the hypothesis that niche partitioning occurs on the basis of mammalian prey size. The key mammalian food items for dingoes/wild dogs across all regions were black wallaby (<italic>Wallabia bicolor</italic>), brushtail possum species (<italic>Trichosurus</italic> spp.), common wombat (<italic>Vombatus ursinus</italic>), sambar deer (<italic>Rusa unicolor</italic>), cattle (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) and European rabbit (<italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>). The key mammalian food items for foxes across all regions were European rabbit, sheep (<italic>Ovis aries</italic>) and house mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>). Foxes consumed 6.1 times the number of individuals of threatened Critical Weight Range native mammal species than did dingoes/wild dogs. The occurrence of intraguild predation was asymmetrical; dingoes/wild dogs consumed greater biomass of the smaller fox. The substantial geographic variation in diet indicates that dingoes/wild dogs and foxes alter their diet in accordance with changing food availability. We provide checklists of taxa recorded in the diets of dingoes/wild dogs and foxes as a resource for managers and researchers wishing to understand the potential impacts of policy and management decisions on dingoes/wild dogs, foxes and the food resources they interact with.</p>},

	abstract = {Reforestation has been widely adopted as a solution to multiple global change issues. However, the role of herbivory by invasive species in the restoration of grassland to forest has received little attention. We conducted a field experiment to investigate the impacts of a widespread invasive mammalian herbivore, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), on trees planted in a landscape-scale reforestation program in south-eastern Australia. Three native tree species were planted inside and outside rabbit-proof exclosures within 10 experimental units, and a random half of the units were subjected to intensive and sustained rabbit control for the remainder of the experiment. Quarterly survival of trees, and total aboveground biomass at the conclusion of the experiment, were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian models. Control substantially reduced rabbit densities on the five treatment units relative to the five non-treatment units. Survival of trees planted outside exclosures was highest at lowest rabbit density and declined non-linearly with increasing rabbit density for all three tree species, but even very low rabbit densities had strong negative effects on the survival of trees outside exclosures. There was a three-way interaction between tree height, being outside an exclosure, and rabbit density. Smaller trees planted outside exclosures always had substantially lower overall survival than trees of the same height planted inside exclosures, and the magnitude of the difference increased with increasing rabbit density. Increasing rabbit densities reduced the overall survival of increasingly taller trees of all three species planted outside exclosures. The aboveground biomass of trees surviving outside exclosures was significantly greater in treatment units compared with non-treatment units for all three species. The combined effects of differential survival and accumulation of aboveground biomass led to higher biomasses inside exclosures relative to outside exclosures just 21 months after planting. The aboveground biomass of trees planted outside exclosures declined with increasing rabbit density, and was effectively zero when rabbit densities exceeded 100 active warren entrances/ha. These results demonstrate that invasive herbivores can rapidly arrest the conversion of grassland to forest. Invasive herbivores such as the European rabbit may need to be completely excluded in order to maximize the benefits of reforestation.},

abstract = "The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a key prey species for most Mediterranean predators in the Iberian Peninsula, including some endangered species such as the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). Rabbit populations in the Iberian Peninsula have collapsed since the arrival of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in the late 1980s. We studied the dietary and numerical responses of five species of mammalian carnivores to this decline in the Doñana National Park (south-west Spain), where \{RHD\} arrived in 1990. Behavioural responses of the Iberian lynx, a rabbit specialist, were also studied through radio-tracking. All carnivores reduced rabbit intake with decreasing rabbit densities immediately after the initial \{RHD\} outbreak, though the level of reduction varied among species. Reductions in rabbit consumption were highest for the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) and the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), low for the genet (Genetta genetta) and mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon), and negligible for the Iberian lynx, thus confirming its strong dependence on rabbits for survival. The Iberian lynx social system was temporarily altered. Female lynxes increased their home range size and no subadult lynxes dispersed in the year following the rabbit crash, causing a temporal local increase of lynx density, which returned to previous values a year after the arrival of RHD. The red fox showed a negative numerical response, reducing its abundance following the rabbit decline. Despite the fact that rabbit consumption was reduced in most carnivores, the role of joint predation is discussed as a factor in the failure of rabbit recovery after this new disease. "
